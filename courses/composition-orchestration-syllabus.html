            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <p>This course is designed to allow beginning and intermediate composers and orchestrators to broaden their
                understanding
                of various compositional techniques and styles through lessons centered around the needs and interests
                of members.
                Members and directors decide on lesson topics together and will also decide on a work of music to score
                read for each
                session.</p>
            <p>Each session will proceed with the following activities, which may be adjusted or omitted to meet time
                constraints:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Score Reading</li>
                <li>Composition/Orchestration Video Lesson</li>
                <li>Topical Composition/Orchestration Lesson</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each member may send a score to a director for feedback during the course.</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Communicate and discuss workable dates and times for each session with other members in the group
                    chat

                </li>
                <li>Join the meeting using the link on a <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y2xhc3Nyb29tMTE1NTkxMDU5NjM4NjYxNTAwMTQyQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20">calendar
                        event</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Expectations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Prepare for each session by accessing <a href="../courses/composition-orchestration.html">the course
                        website</a> and clicking on the correct session day.
                </li>
                <li>Participate actively in activities! These sessions are much more fun when they become
                    discussion-based.</li>
                <li>Put forth your best effort. Some days will be easy and some will be hard, but we want to see what
                    you can do!
                </li>
                <li>If you need extra time before the director moves on to a new activity or new section of a score,
                    please ask!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>It takes time and sustained effort to grow as a composer or orchestrator. Set aside a bit of time
                    every day to write
                    a
                    bit of music, even if it's just a handful of minutes. If that doesn't work, try setting aside time
                    on weekends.</li>
                <li>On some days, you may feel very inspired and write a lot. On others, you might hesitate to commit
                    anything to the page.
                    That's okay! It's more important that you make a consistent effort even if your output isnâ€™t always
                    consistent.</li>
                <li>Listening to music is integral to writing or orchestrating music, so find the time to listen to it.
                    Even if it just
                    means that you listen while doing chores or browsing the web, it will still help. If you want to
                    maximize your benefits,
                    set some time aside to focus on listening to music exclusively, and grab a score of the music to
                    read along!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Be civil and respectful at all times, to all members.</li>

                </li>

            </ol>
